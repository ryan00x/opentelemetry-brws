# Contributing Guide

Welcome! We're excited you're here, and we'd love your help! 

## Prerequisites

If you haven't yet, you will need to get set up following the main [OpenTelemetry Contributor Guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/README.md).

Node and npm versions are dictated by the `package.json` file's `packageManager` and `devEngines` sections.

The easiest way to make sure you are using compatible Node and npm versions is to leverage [nvm](https://www.nvmnode.com/guide/download.html) and the checked in `.nvmrc` file.

```sh
cd <cloned repo directory> 
nvm install
nvm use
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a fork of this repo by clicking on the `Fork` button in the upper right corner of this page. 
2. Clone the repo forked and set the upstream

    ```sh
    # Set to your GitHub username or organization where the repo was forked
    export FORK_OWNER="<your-github-user-or-org>"
    git clone https://github.com/$FORK_OWNER/opentelemetry-browser.git
    cd opentelemetry-browser
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-browser.git
    ```

3. Build and run tests

    ```sh
    npm ci
    npm run build
    npm test
    ```

4. **Prior to receiving review comments**, you can keep your branch up-to-date by using the "Update with rebase" button on Github.com. To rebase manually:

    ```sh
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout <your-branch-name>
    git rebase upstream/main 
    ```

5. **After opening a PR and receiving comments**, you can update your branch and retain comment history by clicking the "Update with merge commit" button on Github.com. To update manually:

   ```sh
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout <your-branch-name>
    git merge upstream/main
   ```

## Guidelines

- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Sign all commits
- Add tests for new functionality
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting

For detailed contribution guidelines, see the [OpenTelemetry JS Contributing Guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Find your first issue

- Open the [Issues](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-browser/issues) tab
- Filter down to label:"good first issue" or label:"available"
- If you are having trouble finding an appropriately sized issue, reach out on Slack or ask in a SIG meeting

## Raising issues

Have a feature request or a bug to report?

Look through [open issues](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-browser/issues) to see if one has already been filed. If so, feel free to react or add a comment.

If not, any of the following work:
- Open an issue using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-browser/issues/new/choose). Examples, screenshots, clear questions, and highlighting decisions to make will make issue triage easier. The Discussion template covers questions and points of consideration.
- Start a thread in [#otel-browser](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C093P0AMP0T) on the CNCF Slack ([create an account](https://slack.cncf.io/) if you need one).
- Add it to the agenda in the [Browser SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/sigs.md#browser) agenda.

## SIG Operations

This section includes processes used by the Browser SIG to get work done.

### Meetings

You can find all the SIG meetings on the main [OpenTelemetry Community](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/tree/main) page.

For this group, there are two relevant SIG meetings to attend:

- **[Browser](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/sigs.md#browser):** Browser is the main implementation SIG meeting focused on issues related to collecting telemetry for web applications.
- **[Client Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/sigs.md#client-instrumentation):** Client Instrumentation is a cross cutting group for client-side telemetry. This group focuses on semantic conventions and other concerns common for all client-side telemetry (e.g. session management).

### Roadmap

Check out what we are working on and where we are heading in our [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)

### Issue Triage

TODO: Document how we triage incoming issues

### Toolchain

TODO: Document the toolchain that we recommend folks use.

## Next Steps

There is a lot more to learn for this SIG and OpenTelemetry in general. Here are some helpful links to contextualize the work you'll be doing.

### General OpenTelemetry Guides

* [OpenTelemetry mission, vision, and values](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/mission-vision-values.md) - this guide helps you understand the direction OpenTelemetry as a whole is heading in and why.
* [General Contribution Lifecycle and Processes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/processes.md) - this guide helps you understand how to find things to work on, get help, and how changes are merged and released.
* [Membership, roles, and responsibilities](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md) - this guide helps the roles and responsibilities of contributors as well as how one advances beyond a member to a triager, approver, or maintainer.

### OpenTelemetry Browser Guides

* [Browser events](docs/browser-observability-model.md) - provides a comprehensive list of browser events emitted by the instrumentation library.
* [Navigation event](docs/navigation-event.md) - documents different types of navigation events and how they are captured.
* [Browser roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) - provides a detailed description of what we are working on and where we are heading.
