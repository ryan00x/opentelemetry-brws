# Browser Events

This document defines browser events for observability and telemetry.

It focuses on the **purpose and description of each event**, rather than defining their individual attributes (which are specified in their respective semantic convention documents).

---

## Goals

The purpose of this document is to:

- Provide a **comprehensive list of browser events** for telemetry.
- Define **the purpose and behavior of each event**.
- Help instrumentation authors and data consumers **understand available browser observability signals**.
- Clarify the **purpose of events without defining their individual attributes**, which are specified in their respective semantic convention documents.

This structure ensures that browser-related events can be consistently interpreted across implementations.
