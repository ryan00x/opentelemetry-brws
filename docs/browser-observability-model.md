# Browser Events

This document defines browser events for observability and telemetry.

It focuses on the **purpose and description of each event**, rather than defining their individual attributes (which are specified in their respective semantic convention documents).

## Design Principles

The browser environment differs from other clients significantly, and there are additional design principles to keep in mind. We've called them out here explicitly so that when working across clients contributors can be sure to keep these at top of mind when working specifically in a browser context.

- **Keep client bundle sizes small:** Clients care a lot about preserving limited client-side resources. Anything that creates more computational burden than necessary - e.g. keeping a span open for longer than it needs to, using a span when it could be a log - is discouraged. Let clients focus on emitting high fidelity events and defer any aggregation or computation to the backend.
- **Prefer definitively reported timing in logs:** Client-side web interactions are highly asynchronous and framework dependent which can make determining when to start or end a span difficult. In cases where attribution is ambiguous or it is difficult to determine when a span should start or end, prefer clearly reported logs.
- **Work with browser constraints, strive for accuracy over approximation:**
    - **Browsers lack native context propagation:** There is no native browser solution for maintaining context from a user click to an asynchronous promise (e.g. a network request). Current workarounds, like Zone.js, are clunky and intrusive. Because there’s no good way to solve the context propagation gap, user interactions will be captured as point-in-time events, and instead rely on timestamps for implicit user interaction/network request association. There is [a proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) for solving this problem, but it has not landed.
    - **Capture async events regardless of page visibility:** W3C browser timing/performance APIs are asynchronous. They capture detailed sub-millisecond durations for HTTP and page load milestones, but the event may be emitted with a slight lag. Strive to capture these events in a way that is resilient to the user navigating away from the page.

## Goals

The purpose of this document is to:

- Provide a **comprehensive list of browser events** for telemetry.
- Define **the purpose and behavior of each event**.
- Help instrumentation authors and data consumers **understand available browser observability signals**.
- Clarify the **purpose of events without defining their individual attributes**, which are specified in their respective semantic convention documents.

This structure ensures that browser-related events can be consistently interpreted across implementations.

## Current status

All events listed below are implemented in this repository's [`@opentelemetry/browser-instrumentation`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-browser/tree/main/packages/instrumentation) package as experimental subpath exports (`./experimental/*`).

In the [semantic-conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions) repository, only `browser.web_vital` (development stability) and `exception` (stable) are currently defined. The earlier PRs proposing conventions for the remaining browser events were closed as stale; the attributes emitted by the instrumentations in this repository serve as the working definitions in the meantime. Longer term, a federated semantic conventions repository for end-user client applications is being discussed ([community #3594](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/3594)). Conventions shared across client platforms may move to that repository, while browser-specific conventions might remain in this repository.
